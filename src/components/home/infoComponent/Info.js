                <p>Since launching in 2017, our commitment to offering Australians peace of mind on one of the biggest investments they will ever make has driven our success. The number of inspections we’ve carried out continues to increase year on year – measurable proof of the quality of our service and impressive growth. Today, as the largest direct-to-consumer building and pest inspection company in Australia, we service thousands of locations* with a continually expanding product offering that caters to the varied needs of property owners. We remain committed to helping Australians buy property with confidence.
